Front-End Development & Design (Member 2)

Responsive Design: Make sure the site looks good on desktop and mobile.
HTML/CSS: Code the website''s front-end using HTML and CSS. You can make it static without back-end functionality (mock-up).
Basic Interactivity: Add simple interactions, like hover effects or a basic image carousel, using vanilla JavaScript or jQuery.
Tools/Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma/Adobe XD for design.


Back-End (Optional / Mock Data) (Member 3)
Since its just a mock website, you wonâ€™t need a full-fledged back-end with databases or live data. Instead, this role would focus on setting up mock data for the front-end and giving the website a more realistic feel.

Create Mock Data: Use a JSON file or simple JavaScript objects to simulate products, categories, user data, and cart functionality.
Integrate with Front-End: Display this mock data on the product listing page, product detail pages, and cart.
Handle Simple Cart Logic: Implement basic cart functionality using JavaScript (e.g., adding/removing products, updating quantities). No actual payment processing required for a mock.
Tools/Technologies: JavaScript, JSON (for mock data), localStorage (optional for saving cart items).


Content & SEO (Member 4)
Responsibilities:
Product Descriptions: Write product descriptions and ensure they are appealing and informative. Add fake product images to make it look realistic.
SEO Basics: Optimize the website for search engines using basic techniques (e.g., adding relevant meta tags, alt text for images, etc.).
Basic Marketing Copy: Create content for the homepage, about us page, FAQ, etc.
Images: Source free stock images for products and banners (websites like Unsplash or Pexels are useful for this).
Tools/Technologies: Google Docs for writing, SEO tools (like Yoast for on-page SEO), and image sources like Unsplash.
